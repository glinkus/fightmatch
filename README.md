# Razbor (Front-End Only)

This repository contains the front-end portion of **Razbor**, a team-built web application developed as part of a university project. The platform enables users to match with others for mock "fight challenges" — a parody social app built with humor.

Built using **React Native**, this front end was developed by me as part of a collaborative effort.  
This version includes only the front-end code I contributed.

## About the Project

- Created as part of a team project for Software Systems Engineering course at Kaunas University of Technology.
- My focus was on front-end UI and user interactions (React Native).
- The full project used a .NET Core back end and followed a microservices architecture.
- Tools used in development: Visual Studio Code, Jira, Bitbucket.
